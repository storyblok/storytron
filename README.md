Example Electron
==============
 
Provides cross-platform development environment, which works the same way on OSX, Windows and Linux, and allows you to generate ready for distribution installers of your app for those operating systems.

# Quick start
The only development dependency of this project is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). So just make sure you have it installed.
Then type few commands known to every Node developer...
```
git clone {thisproject}
cd electron-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
... and boom! You have running desktop application on your screen.

##You don't want to have `example.org`?

Just enter the `background.js` and change the URL.

```
mainWindow.loadURL(`http://www.example.org/`);
```

# Have fun
